<h1>üë®‚Äçüíª About Me</h1>

Hi there! Let me tell you a little about myself. What started as a curiosity about technology turned into a passion that now drives my career. Along the way, I‚Äôve explored various areas of IT, from software development to infrastructure monitoring and automation, always seeking ways to optimize systems.  

Currently, I focus on **Devops Engineer**,  where I design, provision, and operate multiple **Kubernetes clusters** (development and production) on Linux systems using Amazon EKS. My daily work involves leveraging **Terraform** and **AWS** to implement infrastructure as code, scaling and securing clusters, and managing container images with Docker and Amazon ECR.

I specialize in automating infrastructure provisioning with **Terraform**, covering AWS resources such as **EC2, VPC, IAM, Lambda, S3, MSK (Kafka), CloudWatch, and Amazon OpenSearch**. I also develop and optimize CI/CD pipelines using **Jenkins** , **Ansible** and **ArgoCD**, automating builds, tests, and multi-stage deployments for containerized workloads.

My experience extends to managing robust observability stacks with **Grafana, Prometheus, InfluxDB, and Telegraf**, all integrated with **AWS CloudWatch** to provide end-to-end visibility into infrastructure and application performance. 

Previously, I specialized in infrastructure **observability**, **monitoring**, and **incident management** using tools like **Dynatrace**, **Splunk**, and **SQL databases**. In that role, I built and maintained monitoring dashboards, analyzed logs, optimized alerting, and supported infrastructure migrations. In addition to my infrastructure experience, I have hands-on development skills, having worked on **API** development with **Python (Flask)** and **TypeScript (Node.js)**, as well as web applications with **PHP (Laravel)**.

I hold the **AWS Cloud Practitioner** and **Terraform Associate (003)** certifications, and I am currently preparing for the Jenkins Certified Engineer (CJE) certification.




<h2>üíª Projects</h2> <h4>Here you will find a variety of projects I have worked on:</h4> <ul> <li>Practices from my studies, focusing on foundational technologies</li> <li>Personal projects developed independently to expand my skills</li> <li>Courses I‚Äôve participated in, aimed at enhancing my knowledge in DevOps, cloud, and automation</li> </ul>

<a href="https://github.com/jdgc5/Jenkins-Driven-Terraform-and-SSM-Windows-EC2"><b>Jenkins-Driven-Terraform-and-SSM-Windows-EC2</b></a> - A builded and reproducible example to a working AWS environment using pipelines and automation. Step by step, Jenkins will provision IAM, VPC, routes, and an EC2 environment ‚Äî all defined in Terraform. Also, Ansible playbook to keep that EC2 up to date via SSM.

<a href="https://github.com/jdgc5/Terraform_Basic_Boilerplate"> <b>Terraform BoilerPlate</b> </a> - It provides a structured way to manage and deploy AWS infrastructure by Terraform. It includes modular configurations to ensure your files are well structured

<a href="https://github.com/jdgc5/Game_analytics_Api"> <b>Game_analytics_Api</b> </a> - A simple API that provides endpoints to manage game events, player feedback, player progress, and custom level creation.
