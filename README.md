<h1>👨‍💻 About Me</h1>

Hi there! Let me tell you a little about myself. What started as a curiosity about technology turned into a passion that now drives my career. Along the way, I’ve explored various areas of IT, from software development to infrastructure monitoring and automation, always seeking ways to optimize systems.  

Currently, I focus on **infrastructure observability**, **monitoring**, and **incident management**, using tools like **Dynatrace**, **Splunk**, and **SQL databases** to ensure system reliability and performance. I contribute to building monitoring dashboards, analyzing logs, optimizing alerts, and supporting infrastructure migrations. My goal is to deepen my expertise in **DevOps**, **automation**, and **cloud technologies**, and I’m currently working towards **AWS Cloud Practitioner** certification.  

I've also worked on **API development** with **Python** and **Flask**, **web applications** with **Angular**, and **automation** using **Docker** and **GitLab CI/CD**. This mix of **software** and **operations** experience lets me approach problems from a broader perspective—whether debugging an application, optimizing performance, or improving workflows.
